great, tests are now passing. what are next steps?

## Assistant Response

Congratulations on getting the tests to pass! Here are the recommended next steps to further stabilize and enhance your Tree-sitter parser and AST integration for ScopeMux:

### 1. Re-enable and Fix All C++ Query Files
- Restore and validate the `imports.scm` query file (currently disabled/removed due to compilation errors).
- Systematically review and test all `.scm` files in `queries/cpp/` for compatibility with the latest Tree-sitter C++ grammar.
- Add missing queries for constructs you want to support (e.g., namespaces, templates, control flow, etc.).

### 2. Expand Example Coverage
- Populate the example directories (`basic_syntax`, `complex_structures`, `modern_cpp`, `templates`) with a variety of real-world C++ source files.
- Ensure each test category is well-represented to catch regressions and edge cases.

### 3. Improve Query Diagnostics and Error Handling
- Add more granular logging for query compilation and matching failures.
- Consider adding test cases that intentionally use malformed queries to verify robust error handling.

### 4. Refine Node Type Mapping and AST Post-Processing
- Audit `node_type_mapping.json` for completeness and correctness.
- Expand the mapping to cover new semantic constructs as needed.
- Review and enhance AST post-processing and validation logic.

### 5. Documentation and Developer Experience
- Document the requirements for adding new languages or semantic queries.
- Add README sections describing the dual-mode CST/AST architecture and how to extend it.

### 6. Continuous Integration and Maintenance
- Integrate these tests into your CI pipeline (if not already done).
- Periodically update Tree-sitter grammars and queries to track upstream changes.

### 7. Feature Expansion (Optional)
- Implement advanced semantic queries (e.g., call graph, symbol resolution).
- Add support for additional languages using the same architecture.

If you want to focus on any particular area next (e.g., query file repair, more C++ features, or multi-language support), let me know and I can help you plan and implement it step-by-step.
