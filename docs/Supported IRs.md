**What are the different forms of intermediate representations this project supports?**

For your **ScopeMux** and **ipynb-Integration** projects, the Intermediate Representation (IR) layer is key to enabling structured understanding, compression, and transformation of source materials (code or notebooks). The IR forms act as bridges between raw syntax trees and higher-level InfoBlocks or semantic queries.

Here are the **different forms of IR** your system should or could support, categorized by purpose:

***

## üîπ 1. **Structural IRs (Syntax-Preserving)**

These IRs preserve the structure of the original content but abstract away surface-level syntax:

### ‚úÖ **AST-Reduced IR**

* Source: Tree-sitter or Python AST
* Flattened/filtered AST with only semantically meaningful nodes
* Removes tokens like braces, commas, etc.
* Use: Foundation for tiering, context slicing, and graph generation

### ‚úÖ **Symbol IR**

* Contains all declarations: functions, classes, variables, imports
* Includes:
  * Signature
  * Scope
  * Visibility (public/private)
  * Metadata (docstrings, decorators)
* Use: Fast lookup, context-tiering, IDE jump-to-definition

***

## üîπ 2. **Relational / Graph IRs**

These are more abstract and semantic, built on top of AST or symbol information:

### ‚úÖ **Call Graph IR**

* Nodes: Functions or methods
* Edges: Function/method calls
* Use: Dependency tracking, execution mapping, backtracking stack traces

### ‚úÖ **Data Flow IR**

* Tracks how data moves across variables/functions
* Shows assignment, mutation, propagation
* Use: Refactor safety checks, variable usage compression

### ‚úÖ **Import/Dependency IR**

* Modules/files as nodes
* Edges for import/include/use statements
* Use: Prune large codebases, module-tier context slicing

***

## üîπ 3. **Semantic IRs (Meaning-Preserving)**

These IRs focus on capturing *intent*, purpose, or user-facing meaning:

### ‚úÖ **Docstring IR**

* Extracts only docstrings, grouped by file/symbol
* Can be flattened, hierarchically nested, or aligned to symbol IR
* Use: Code summarization, documentation previews

### ‚úÖ **Activity IR**

* Inspired by UML activity diagrams
* Captures control flow: conditions, loops, branching logic
* Abstracts away details to show *what the code does*
* Use: High-level overviews, strategy simulation, planning

### ‚úÖ **Notebook Execution IR (for ipynb)**

* Tracks code cell execution order, variable state, and dependencies
* Maintains which variables/functions were defined or overwritten by which cells
* Use: Reproducibility tools, cell impact analysis, smart re-execution

***

## üîπ 4. **Tiered Context IR (Compression-Aware)**

Special to your project:

### ‚úÖ **Context Tiers IR**

* Maps each InfoBlock to its level of abstraction:
  * Tier 0: Local line or statement
  * Tier 1: Function/class body
  * Tier 2: File/module level
  * Tier 3: Project/graph level
* Use: Enables ScopeMux‚Äôs intelligent expansion/compression pipeline

***

## üîπ 5. **Metadata/Annotation IRs**

Optional overlays for control, tracking, or debugging:

### ‚úÖ **Error Annotation IR**

* Stores error or warning messages tied to IR nodes
* Use: Diagnostic compression, LLM debug prompts

### ‚úÖ **Edit History IR**

* Tracks mutations of files or notebooks over time
* Use: Time-travel analysis, change detection, and contextual caching

***

Would you like a schema or example JSON representation of one or more of these IR types?

Absolutely ‚Äî **you are not limited to predefined IR types**. In fact, for a system like **ScopeMux**, designing custom IRs is not only allowed but encouraged. Your IRs should reflect:

* The **questions** you want LLMs to answer,
* The **transformations** your tooling needs (e.g.¬†compression, visualization),
* And the **granularity** of semantic meaning you want to preserve or expose.

***

## ‚úÖ You Can Create Your Own IRs ‚Äî Here‚Äôs How to Think About It

### üîß 1. **Define Your Use Case First**

Ask:

* Do I want to visualize execution flow?
* Do I need LLMs to summarize logic at the function level?
* Am I filtering code for inclusion in a context window?
* Am I trying to detect unused variables or dead code?

Each of those justifies a different IR shape.

***

### üß± 2. **Design Custom IR Formats**

Use a nested JSON-like schema or a binary format if speed is critical.

Examples:

### üî∏ A *ControlFlowBlock IR*:

```json
{  "type": "loop",  "condition": "i < len(data)",  "body": [    {"type": "assignment", "lhs": "total", "rhs": "total + data[i]"}  ]}
```

### üî∏ A *CurrencyTradeModel IR* (domain-specific):

```json
{  "entity": "strategy",  "name": "carry_trade",  "inputs": ["interest_rate_diff", "volatility"],  "decision_logic": {    "buy_if": "interest_rate_diff > 1.5 and volatility < 0.3",    "sell_if": "interest_rate_diff < 0.5"  },  "tags": ["forex", "macro", "mean_reversion"]}
```

***

### üí° 3. **Optionally Derive from Existing IRs**

You can use your AST/Symbol IR as a **base layer**, then enrich it:

* Add `metrics` (e.g., line count, complexity)
* Add `annotations` (e.g., ‚Äúfrequently modified‚Äù)
* Attach `context tiers` for ScopeMux compression logic

***

### üß¨ 4. **Store and Query Custom IRs Like a Database**

If you define IRs consistently, you can:

* Serialize to JSON or Protobuf
* Index them with SQLite, Postgres, or a vector store
* Query them like a knowledge graph or LLM context database

***

## üöÄ Example: Your Own Tier-Aware IR

```json
{  "tier": 1,  "symbol": "process_data",  "type": "function",  "args": ["data", "config"],  "activity": [    {"type": "filter", "condition": "x > config.threshold"},    {"type": "map", "expression": "x * config.scale"},    {"type": "return", "value": "result"}  ],  "doc": "Processes incoming data using a filtering and scaling pipeline."}
```

***

If you tell me the *goal* of the custom IR you‚Äôre imagining (e.g., strategy flow, graph structure, teaching-oriented summaries), I can help design the structure with you.

***

**You:**

differences between IR and Tiered Contexts?

***

**ChatGPT:**

Great question ‚Äî while **Intermediate Representations (IR)** and **Tiered Contexts** both play a role in interpreting and organizing code, they serve different purposes and operate at different levels of abstraction.

***

## üîç Summary Table

| Feature | **Intermediate Representation (IR)** | **Tiered Contexts** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | Canonical, structured representation of code semantics | Dynamic filtering and exposure of context to an LLM |
| **Focus** | *What the code is / does* | *How much of the code to show* |
| **Granularity** | Symbol-level, control/data flow, logical graphs | Line-level, function-level, module-level, or project-level |
| **Static/Dynamic** | Static snapshot of source meaning | Dynamically selected based on query, compression, or interaction |
| **Examples** | Symbol IR, AST-reduced IR, Call Graph, Activity IR | Tier 0 (line), Tier 1 (function), Tier 2 (file), Tier 3 (project) |
| **Format** | Usually structured JSON or graph-based | Integer-based tier annotations + slicing logic |
| **Used by** | Parsers, analyzers, compressors | ScopeMux context expander/compressor, IDE LLM integrations |
| **Analogy** | Blueprint of a building | What parts of the building you let someone see through a window |

***

## üß© How They Work Together

Think of IRs as the **raw material**, and Tiered Contexts as the **viewports** or **lenses** you apply to that material.

### ‚úÖ IR Example

```json
{  "type": "function",  "name": "calculate_interest",  "args": ["principal", "rate", "time"],  "body": [...],  "doc": "Computes compound interest."}
```

### ‚úÖ Tiered Context Mapping

```json
{  "symbol": "calculate_interest",  "tier": 1,          // Function-level  "infoblock_id": "abc123",  "compressed_size": 1024,  "relevance_score": 0.89}
```

In this case:

* The **IR** captures *what* the function does.
* The **tiered context** tells ScopeMux *when and how much* of it to show based on space, relevance, or query focus.

***

## üìò Think of it This Way

* IR is like a **source of truth**: all possible knowledge about the code.
* Tiered Context is like **intelligent partial disclosure**: ‚Äúonly show the most relevant 10% at Tier 1 unless the user drills deeper.‚Äù

***

Would you like a visual diagram showing how IR feeds into InfoBlocks and how Tiered Contexts decide what to expose?
