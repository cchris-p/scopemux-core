# Generalized Reference Resolution Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the implementation plan for a unified, language-agnostic reference resolution core in ScopeMux, with language-specific hooks. All language resolvers (Python, C, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.) should delegate qualified name and scope resolution to this core, only implementing language-unique behaviors (such as import/include handling or member lookup rules).

---

## Core Implementation

### Core Module

- **Location:** `core/src/parser/reference_resolvers/reference_resolution_core.c` and `.h`

#### Responsibilities

- **Qualified Name Resolution:**  
  - Resolves names with multiple segments (e.g., `a.b.c`, `ns::foo::bar`) by recursive lookup.
  - Supports both symbol table and AST-based lookup.

- **Scope Resolution:**  
  - Walks up the AST and/or symbol table parent chain.
  - Supports local, enclosing, and global scopes.
  - Delegates scope rules to language hooks.

- **Reference Type Inference:**  
  - Provides helpers to infer `ReferenceType` from AST node context.
  - Language-specific logic can override via hooks.

- **Logging and Statistics:**  
  - Centralized logging of all lookup attempts, successes, failures, and ambiguities.
  - Tracks statistics by scope and reference type.

#### API Example

```c
typedef struct {
    // Function pointers for language-specific behaviors
    SymbolEntry *(*lookup_import)(const char *name, void *context);
    SymbolEntry *(*lookup_attribute)(ASTNode *base, const char *attr, void *context);
    // ... more hooks as needed
} LanguageResolverHooks;

ResolutionStatus reference_resolution_core_resolve(
    ASTNode *start_node,
    const char *qualified_name,
    ReferenceType ref_type,
    GlobalSymbolTable *symbol_table,
    const LanguageResolverHooks *hooks,
    void *resolver_context
);
```

## Language Resolver Refactoring

- All language resolvers (`python_resolver.c`, `c_resolver.c`, `cpp_resolver.c`, `javascript_resolver.c`, `typescript_resolver.c`) must:
  - Replace their internal qualified name and scope resolution logic with calls to the core.
  - Implement and pass appropriate `LanguageResolverHooks`.
  - Remove any direct fallback to builtinsâ€”**builtin fallback is not supported** in the generalized core and must be removed from all languages.
  - Ensure all changes to names, enums, or API signatures are reflected everywhere (tests, headers, docs).

---

## Naming and Consistency

- Any new or refactored function, type, or enum name must be updated in:
  - All resolver implementations.
  - All test cases and golden files.
  - All documentation and code comments.
- Canonical enums (e.g., `ReferenceType`) must be used consistently.

---

## Test Suite

- **Directory:**  
  `core/tests/`
- **Relevant files:**  
  - `reference_resolver_tests.c`
  - `language_resolver_tests.c`
  - Any new cross-language or core API tests should be added here.

## Example: Most Refactored (Canonical) Python Resolver

```c
ResolutionStatus python_resolver_impl(ASTNode *node, ReferenceType ref_type, const char *name,
                                      GlobalSymbolTable *symbol_table, void *resolver_data) {
    static LanguageResolverHooks hooks = {
        .lookup_import = python_lookup_import,
        .lookup_attribute = python_lookup_attribute,
        // ...other hooks
    };
    return reference_resolution_core_resolve(
        node, name, ref_type, symbol_table, &hooks, resolver_data
    );
}
```

---

**This architecture ensures all languages benefit from robust, maintainable, and consistent reference resolution, while allowing for language-specific extension where required.**
