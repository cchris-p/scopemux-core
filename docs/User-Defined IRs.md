For a system like **ScopeMux**, designing custom IRs is not only allowed but encouraged. Users‚Äô IRs should reflect:

* The **questions** users want LLMs to answer,
* The **transformations** users‚Äô tooling needs (e.g., compression, visualization),
* And the **granularity** of semantic meaning users want to preserve or expose.

***

### üîß 1. **Define the Use Case First**

Users might ask:

* Do users want to visualize execution flow?
* Do users need LLMs to summarize logic at the function level?
* Are users filtering code for inclusion in a context window?
* Are users trying to detect unused variables or dead code?

Each of those justifies a different IR shape.

***

### üß± 2. **Design Custom IR Formats**

Use a nested JSON-like schema or a binary format if speed is critical.

Examples:

### üî∏ A *ControlFlowBlock IR*:

```json
{  "type": "loop",  "condition": "i < len(data)",  "body": [    {"type": "assignment", "lhs": "total", "rhs": "total + data[i]"}  ]}

```

### üî∏ A *CurrencyTradeModel IR* (domain-specific):

```json
{  "entity": "strategy",  "name": "carry_trade",  "inputs": ["interest_rate_diff", "volatility"],  "decision_logic": {    "buy_if": "interest_rate_diff > 1.5 and volatility < 0.3",    "sell_if": "interest_rate_diff < 0.5"  },  "tags": ["forex", "macro", "mean_reversion"]}

```

***

### üí° 3. **Optionally Derive from Existing IRs**

Users can use their AST/Symbol IR as a **base layer**, then enrich it:

* Add `metrics` (e.g., line count, complexity)
* Add `annotations` (e.g., ‚Äúfrequently modified‚Äù)
* Attach `context tiers` for ScopeMux compression logic

***

### üß¨ 4. **Store and Query Custom IRs Like a Database**

If users define IRs consistently, they can:

* Serialize to JSON or Protobuf
* Index them with SQLite, Postgres, or a vector store
* Query them like a knowledge graph or LLM context database

***

## üöÄ Example: Users‚Äô Own Tier-Aware IR

```json
{  "tier": 1,  "symbol": "process_data",  "type": "function",  "args": ["data", "config"],  "activity": [    {"type": "filter", "condition": "x > config.threshold"},    {"type": "map", "expression": "x * config.scale"},    {"type": "return", "value": "result"}  ],  "doc": "Processes incoming data using a filtering and scaling pipeline."}

```

***

If users define the *goal* of the custom IR they‚Äôre imagining (e.g., strategy flow, graph structure, teaching-oriented summaries), they can design the structure accordingly.

***

**Users:**

differences between IR and Tiered Contexts?

***

**Technical Overview:**

While **Intermediate Representations (IR)** and **Tiered Contexts** both play a role in interpreting and organizing code, they serve different purposes and operate at different levels of abstraction.

***

## üîç Summary Table

| Feature | **Intermediate Representation (IR)** | **Tiered Contexts** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | Canonical, structured representation of code semantics | Dynamic filtering and exposure of context to an LLM |
| **Focus** | *What the code is / does* | *How much of the code to show* |
| **Granularity** | Symbol-level, control/data flow, logical graphs | Line-level, function-level, module-level, or project-level |
| **Static/Dynamic** | Static snapshot of source meaning | Dynamically selected based on query, compression, or interaction |
| **Examples** | Symbol IR, AST-reduced IR, Call Graph, Activity IR | Tier 0 (line), Tier 1 (function), Tier 2 (file), Tier 3 (project) |
| **Format** | Usually structured JSON or graph-based | Integer-based tier annotations + slicing logic |
| **Used by** | Parsers, analyzers, compressors | ScopeMux context expander/compressor, IDE LLM integrations |
| **Analogy** | Blueprint of a building | What parts of the building users let someone see through a window |

***

## üß© How They Work Together

Think of IRs as the **raw material**, and Tiered Contexts as the **viewports** or **lenses** users apply to that material.

### ‚úÖ IR Example

```json
{  "type": "function",  "name": "calculate_interest",  "args": ["principal", "rate", "time"],  "body": [...],  "doc": "Computes compound interest."}

```

### ‚úÖ Tiered Context Mapping

```json
{  "symbol": "calculate_interest",  "tier": 1,          // Function-level  "infoblock_id": "abc123",  "compressed_size": 1024,  "relevance_score": 0.89}

```

In this case:

* The **IR** captures *what* the function does.
* The **tiered context** tells ScopeMux *when and how much* of it to show based on space, relevance, or query focus.

***

## üìò Think of it This Way

* IR is like a **source of truth**: all possible knowledge about the code.
* Tiered Context is like **intelligent partial disclosure**: ‚Äúonly show the most relevant 10% at Tier 1 unless the user drills deeper.‚Äù
