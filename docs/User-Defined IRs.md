For a system like **ScopeMux**, designing custom IRs is not only allowed but encouraged. Users' IRs should reflect:

* The **questions** users want LLMs to answer,
* The **transformations** users' tooling needs (e.g., compression, visualization),
* And the **granularity** of semantic meaning users want to preserve or expose.

***

### 🔧 1. **Define the Use Case First**

Users might ask:

* Do users want to visualize execution flow?
* Do users need LLMs to summarize logic at the function level?
* Are users filtering code for inclusion in a context window?
* Are users trying to detect unused variables or dead code?

Each of those justifies a different IR shape.

***

### 🧱 2. **Design Custom IR Formats**

Use a nested JSON-like schema or a binary format if speed is critical.

Examples:

### 🔸 A *ControlFlowBlock IR*:

```json
{
  "type": "loop",
  "condition": "i < len(data)",
  "body": [
    {"type": "assignment", "lhs": "total", "rhs": "total + data[i]"}
  ]
}
```

### 🔸 A *CurrencyTradeModel IR* (domain-specific):

```json
{
  "entity": "strategy",
  "name": "carry_trade",
  "inputs": ["interest_rate_diff", "volatility"],
  "decision_logic": {
    "buy_if": "interest_rate_diff > 1.5 and volatility < 0.3",
    "sell_if": "interest_rate_diff < 0.5"
  },
  "tags": ["forex", "macro", "mean_reversion"]
}
```

***

### 💡 3. **Optionally Derive from Existing IRs**

Users can use their AST/Symbol IR as a **base layer**, then enrich it:

* Add `metrics` (e.g., line count, complexity)
* Add `annotations` (e.g., "frequently modified")
* Attach `context tiers` for ScopeMux compression logic

***

### 🧬 4. **Store and Query Custom IRs Like a Database**

If users define IRs consistently, they can:

* Serialize to JSON or Protobuf
* Index them with SQLite, Postgres, or a vector store
* Query them like a knowledge graph or LLM context database

***

## 🚀 Example: Users' Own Tier-Aware IR

```json
{
  "tier": 1,
  "symbol": "process_data",
  "type": "function",
  "args": ["data", "config"],
  "activity": [
    {"type": "filter", "condition": "x > config.threshold"},
    {"type": "map", "expression": "x * config.scale"},
    {"type": "return", "value": "result"}
  ],
  "doc": "Processes incoming data using a filtering and scaling pipeline."
}
```

***

## 🚀 Example: Users’ Own Tier-Aware IR

```json
{
  "tier": 1,
  "symbol": "process_data",
  "type": "function",
  "args": ["data", "config"],
  "activity": [
    {"type": "filter", "condition": "x > config.threshold"},
    {"type": "map", "expression": "x * config.scale"},
    {"type": "return", "value": "result"}
  ],
  "doc": "Processes incoming data using a filtering and scaling pipeline."
}
```

## 🧩 InfoBlock Templates and Variable Omission

### How It Works

Users can build compositions of InfoBlocks as templates with variables omitted:

1. **Template Creation**
   * Users select relevant InfoBlocks (functions, classes, modules)
   * System generates a "skeleton" with implementation details abstracted
   * Variables, constants, and implementation details can be optionally omitted

2. **LLM Context Injection**
   * These templates are injected into the LLM context window
   * Preserves structure and signatures while reducing token usage
   * Focuses LLM attention on the relevant components

3. **Future Automation**
   * An agent will map natural language requests to relevant InfoBlocks
   * "Add validation to the user signup flow" → automatically pulls in user model and validation InfoBlocks
   * Templates can be stored and reused for common patterns

### Example Template

```json
{
  "template_type": "variable_omitted",
  "blocks": [
    {
      "symbol": "authenticate_user",
      "signature": "def authenticate_user(username: str, password: str) -> User:",
      "implementation": "<OMITTED>",
      "doc": "Authenticates a user against the database"
    },
    {
      "symbol": "User",
      "type": "class",
      "methods": ["validate", "save", "get_permissions"],
      "attributes": ["username", "email", "role"],
      "implementations": "<OMITTED>"
    }
  ]
}
```

This approach maintains structural knowledge while reducing context size, allowing LLMs to focus on architecture and relationships rather than implementation details.

***

If users define the *goal* of the custom IR they’re imagining (e.g., strategy flow, graph structure, teaching-oriented summaries), they can design the structure accordingly.

***

**Users:**

differences between IR and Tiered Contexts?

***

**Technical Overview:**

While **Intermediate Representations (IR)** and **Tiered Contexts** both play a role in interpreting and organizing code, they serve different purposes and operate at different levels of abstraction.

***

## 🔍 Summary Table

| Feature | **Intermediate Representation (IR)** | **Tiered Contexts** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | Canonical, structured representation of code semantics | Dynamic filtering and exposure of context to an LLM |
| **Focus** | *What the code is / does* | *How much of the code to show* |
| **Granularity** | Symbol-level, control/data flow, logical graphs | Line-level, function-level, module-level, or project-level |
| **Static/Dynamic** | Static snapshot of source meaning | Dynamically selected based on query, compression, or interaction |
| **Examples** | Symbol IR, AST-reduced IR, Call Graph, Activity IR | Tier 0 (line), Tier 1 (function), Tier 2 (file), Tier 3 (project) |
| **Format** | Usually structured JSON or graph-based | Integer-based tier annotations + slicing logic |
| **Used by** | Parsers, analyzers, compressors | ScopeMux context expander/compressor, IDE LLM integrations |
| **Analogy** | Blueprint of a building | What parts of the building users let someone see through a window |

***

## 🧩 How They Work Together

Think of IRs as the **raw material**, and Tiered Contexts as the **viewports** or **lenses** users apply to that material.

### ✅ IR Example

```json
{  "type": "function",  "name": "calculate_interest",  "args": ["principal", "rate", "time"],  "body": [...],  "doc": "Computes compound interest."}

```

### ✅ Tiered Context Mapping

```json
{  "symbol": "calculate_interest",  "tier": 1,          // Function-level  "infoblock_id": "abc123",  "compressed_size": 1024,  "relevance_score": 0.89}

```

In this case:

* The **IR** captures *what* the function does.
* The **tiered context** tells ScopeMux *when and how much* of it to show based on space, relevance, or query focus.

***

## 📘 Think of it This Way

* IR is like a **source of truth**: all possible knowledge about the code.
* Tiered Context is like **intelligent partial disclosure**: “only show the most relevant 10% at Tier 1 unless the user drills deeper.”

## ❓ Composable InfoBlocks as Templates for LLM Context

**Question:** How will this work / how does this fit in: Users can build a composition of InfoBlocks as a template to submit as a “file with variables omitted” into the LLM context with every — later automate this feature by introducing an agent that maps written-out requests with the relevant InfoBlocks.

**Answer:**

This describes a **user-driven InfoBlock composer** that feeds a **partial or templated program context** into the LLM, and later transitions to an **agent-driven autocomposer** based on natural language understanding.

Let’s break it down clearly:

### 🧠 Concept: “Composable InfoBlocks as Variable-Omitted Templates”

#### 🔷 What It Is

A system where users can manually or programmatically assemble a group of InfoBlocks, optionally masking/removing variables or implementations, and submit that bundle into the LLM context — to scaffold, validate, or complete tasks.

This composition:

* Is based on *user intent* (e.g., “I want to refactor the email pipeline”)
* Removes variable values, function bodies, or fine-grained control-flow to **reduce context size**
* Preserves *structure*, *types*, and *symbolic relationships*

***

### 🔧 How It Works – Step-by-Step

#### 🪛 Manual Phase (MVP)

1. **User selects InfoBlocks** from project:
   * via UI (Windsurf, Cursor extension)
   * or CLI like:
     ```bash
     scopemux compose email --include "send_email" --include "validate_input"
     ```
2. **System generates a partial context**:
   * Full symbol signatures (classes, functions)
   * Docstrings and type annotations
   * Omit or abstract: variable values, long impls, magic numbers
3. **Context is injected into an LLM request**:
   * Used as prompt for: “Refactor this”, “Explain this flow”, “Add logging”

***

#### 🤖 Future Phase – Agent Automation

1. **User writes a natural language request**:
   > “Add email verification to the onboarding flow and reuse the email utils.”
2. **LLM agent parses the request**:
   * Detects intent + named entities
   * Uses semantic search (pgvector) + IR graph traversal to **resolve matching InfoBlocks**
3. **System auto-composes Tiered Context** from those blocks:
   * Uses relevance scoring, proximity, call relationships
   * Adds abstraction level config (e.g., “Tier 1 only”)
4. **LLM receives masked or abstracted version** for task execution:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "template",
     "blocks": [
       {
         "symbol": "send_email",
         "mask": "body", // function body masked, signature retained
         "doc": true
       },
       {
         "symbol": "EmailValidator",
         "mask": "inline_values"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

***

### 🔁 How It Fits Into the System

This feature plugs directly into the ScopeMux pipeline:

```
Raw Files
   ↓
Tree-sitter
   ↓
Intermediate Representations
   ↓
InfoBlocks (granular, typed, tagged)
   ↓
📦 Composable Bundles (masked or templated)
   ↓
🎯 Tiered Contexts (based on use-case)
   ↓
🧠 LLM for editing / design / scaffolding
```

***

### ✅ Benefits

* **Context efficiency**: Only the structure the LLM needs
* **Customization**: Users or agents can define what is “essential”
* **Reusability**: Templates can be saved for common tasks (e.g., onboarding, logging, DB queries)
* **Scalability**: Reduces token load for large monorepos
* **Auditability**: Can view/debug the “inputs” the LLM was given
