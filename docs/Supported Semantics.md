Absolutely — here's a structured breakdown of **all the IRs your project (ScopeMux/ipynb-Integration) can support**, categorized by inspiration, purpose, and downstream usage (like real-time UML updates, TieredContexts, or LLM prompts).

***

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

Your **IRs (Intermediate Representations)** are semantically rich abstractions *built on top of the AST*. They are meant to:

* **Encode meaning**: definitions, control flow, types, dependencies.
* **Drive views**: like UML diagrams, function call maps, or API summaries.
* **Feed TieredContexts**: as compressed, interpretable formats for downstream LLMs.

The **UML-style visualization** you mentioned would be a *TieredContext view* **generated from one or more IRs**.

***

## 🧱 Categories of IRs You Can Support

### 1. **Symbol IR**

* **Structure**: Exception origin → handler path.
* **Feeds**:
  * Error propagation diagrams
  * Resilience/Uptime modeling

***

### 7. **Memory/Object Lifetime IR**

> 🧠 Inspired by heap/stack graphs.

* **Purpose**: Track creation, references, and lifetimes of objects (esp. in OOP or systems code).
* **Feeds**:
  * UML Object Diagrams
  * Scope-aware memory snapshots
  * Python/C++ destructor lifecycle tracing

***

### 10. **Test Coverage IR**

> 🧪 Source-to-test mapping.

* **Purpose**: Track testable units and coverage.
* **Feeds**:
  * Test vs. Code Matrix
  * Critical Path Testing Tiers
  * Missing test suggestions

***

## 🧩 Sample Flow: UML Diagram from IRs

For example, a **UML Class Diagram** might be generated using:

* `Symbol IR` (for class/function defs)
* `Type IR` (for attribute/method types)
* `Import IR` (for external references)
* → transformed into a **TieredContext UML View**, which updates in real time.

***

## 🗺️ Future or Advanced IRs

* **Semantic IR**: Natural-language summary of purpose/behavior per symbol (LLM-assisted).
* **Concurrency IR**: Maps threads, async calls, locks.
* **Contract IR**: Captures input/output constraints, pre/post-conditions.
* **Regulatory IR**: Extracts GDPR, safety, or compliance-related logic.

***

## 💡 Summary Table

| IR Name | Feeds Into | UML-Related? | Core Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Symbol IR | Class Diagram, API map | ✅ | Def/use tracking |
| Call Graph IR | Sequence Diagram | ✅ | Func/Method topology |
| Activity IR | Activity Diagram | ✅ | Logic flow (CFG) |
| Type IR | Attribute/method types | ✅ | Type introspection |
| Import/Dep IR | Component Diagram | ✅ | Package/module flow |

| Memory IR | Object Diagram | ✅ | Lifetime/model diagrams |
| Doc IR | Class/API summaries | Partial | LLM doc views |
| Execution Trace IR | Sequence, Performance Diagrams | ✅ | Real-time behavior |
| Test Coverage IR | Test ↔ Code Tier Map | Indirect | QA and safety views |

***

If you'd like, I can help define the **data schema for each IR** or write the transformer from AST → IR (in C or Python).

Excellent question — and crucial for architecting ScopeMux properly.

***

## 🔄 TL;DR:

* **IRs** are *raw semantic models* extracted from the AST.
* **Tiered Contexts** are *compressed, curated views* built **on top of one or more IRs**, tailored for specific use cases like:
  * LLM prompt injection
  * Diagrams
  * UI panes
  * Navigation tools

**IRs = structured knowledge graph**

**Tiered Contexts = human/LLM-consumable slices of that graph**

***

## 🧱 Why Are These IRs and Not Tiered Contexts?

### ✅ 1. **IRs capture full structure and semantics**

IRs are meant to be **complete and lossless** representations of a specific semantic property of code (symbols, control flow, imports, etc). Think of each IR like a normalized SQL table or a graph database:

* `SymbolIR`: every defined entity, its type, scope, and location.
* `CallGraphIR`: every call edge in the code.
* `ActivityIR`: every control flow path through methods.

They don’t care **who consumes them** yet — just that they’re **accurate and richly structured**.

***

### 🧰 2. **Tiered Contexts are views** (derived from IRs)

Once you’ve built your IRs, you selectively **compress, filter, or slice** them into **Tiered Contexts**, depending on the consumer:

| Consumer Type | Tiered Context Example |
| --- | --- |
| LLM | Function call map + class summaries + comments |
| Diagram (UML) | Class defs + types + relations from `SymbolIR` |
| IDE sidebar | Docstrings + definitions only |
| Autocomplete engine | Local `SymbolIR` for file + type data |
| Error checker | Control flow + exception IR |

Each Tiered Context answers:

**“What subset of IR data do I need to inject into this interface?”**

***

## 🧠 Design Choice Justification

### ✅ Keep IRs atomic and reusable:

> Let each IR solve one semantic concern and be independent.

* This lets you recompute just one IR when only a subset of the code changes.
* You can **cache**, **compose**, or **diff** IRs cheaply.

### ✅ Let Tiered Contexts remain dynamic:

> They're runtime, user-facing, task-aware views.

* You may have dozens of contexts built from the same IRs:
  * `"docstring-only context"` from `SymbolIR + DocIR`
  * `"test coverage heatmap"` from `SymbolIR + CoverageIR`
  * `"regime change prompt"` from `ActivityIR + ExceptionIR`

***

## 🎯 Analogy

### IRs are like:

* **SQL tables**
* **Compiler passes**
* **Normalized knowledge graphs**

### Tiered Contexts are like:

* **SQL views**
* **Frontend slices**
* **LLM input builders**

***

## ✅ Summary

| Concept | Role | Lifespan | Consumers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **IR** | Full structured semantic model | Persistent | Tier builder, visualizer |
| **Tiered Context** | Custom view for a purpose/task | Runtime/dynamic | LLM, GUI, debugger, IDE |

> 🧠 Key rule:
>
> **IRs are what you index and search.**
>
> **Tiered Contexts are what you show or feed into models.**

Would you like a sample TieredContext built from 2 IRs to illustrate this?

Great. Let’s walk through a concrete example: building a **TieredContext for UML Class Diagrams**, using two IRs: `SymbolIR` and `TypeIR`.

***

## 🧱 Step 1: IRs (the raw data)

### 🧩 `SymbolIR` (example)

```json
[
  {
    "kind": "class",
    "name": "Account",
    "location": "bank/models/account.py:5",
    "methods": ["__init__", "deposit", "withdraw"],
    "attributes": ["balance", "owner"]
  },
  {
    "kind": "function",
    "name": "transfer",
    "location": "bank/models/account.py:42",
    "calls": ["Account.withdraw", "Account.deposit"]
  }
]

```

### 🧩 `TypeIR` (example)

```json
[
  { "symbol": "Account.balance", "type": "float" },
  { "symbol": "Account.owner", "type": "User" },
  { "symbol": "Account.deposit", "args": ["float"], "return": "None" },
  { "symbol": "Account.withdraw", "args": ["float"], "return": "bool" },
  { "symbol": "transfer", "args": ["Account", "Account", "float"], "return": "bool" }
]

```

***

## 🧠 Step 2: Combine into a **TieredContext**

Now we synthesize a **TieredContext** that serves the purpose:

> "Generate a UML class diagram view of core banking models."

This TieredContext might look like:

```json
{
  "name": "uml_class_diagram:bank.models",
  "source_IRs": ["SymbolIR", "TypeIR"],
  "context_type": "uml_class_diagram",
  "entities": [
    {
      "type": "class",
      "name": "Account",
      "attributes": [
        { "name": "balance", "type": "float" },
        { "name": "owner", "type": "User" }
      ],
      "methods": [
        { "name": "__init__", "signature": "(self)" },
        { "name": "deposit", "signature": "(self, amount: float) -> None" },
        { "name": "withdraw", "signature": "(self, amount: float) -> bool" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "relations": [
    {
      "from": "transfer",
      "to": "Account.deposit",
      "kind": "calls"
    },
    {
      "from": "transfer",
      "to": "Account.withdraw",
      "kind": "calls"
    }
  ]
}

```

This can be:

* Rendered into a live-updating **UML class diagram**
* Injected into an LLM as a "class skeleton"
* Used in the IDE’s “class browser” sidebar

***

## 🔁 Dynamic Update Flow

1. Code change (e.g., `Account.add_interest()` is added).
2. `SymbolIR` delta is recomputed incrementally.
3. `TypeIR` picks up type signature for the new method.
4. **TieredContext** re-renders diagram and syncs with WebSocket or LLM cache.

***

## 🔮 Bonus: Other TieredContext Types You Could Build

| Name | IRs Used | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `prompt_context:class_summary` | SymbolIR + DocIR | Inject class names + docstrings into LLM |
| `coverage_context:untested_paths` | SymbolIR + TestCoverageIR | Show only untested methods |
| `activity_view:login_flow` | ActivityIR + ExceptionIR | Visualize flow of login logic |
| `api_surface:public_endpoints` | SymbolIR + ImportIR + DocIR | List public API functions/modules |

***

## ✅ Summary

* The **IRs** are structured, comprehensive, reusable.
* The **TieredContext** is a *filtered, composed*, and *purpose-driven* view derived from IRs.
* One TieredContext might combine **many IRs**, and can be:
  * Rendered visually
  * Used for navigation
  * Injected into LLMs

Would you like code to generate this TieredContext automatically from JSON IR inputs?

Would this be InfoBlocks, TieredContexts or IR?

A selection of multiple functions pprovided in a file and usage in a class of another file

A selection of all docstrings in a directory

A selection of all functions and all public variables (consts, enums, ints, etc) (exccluding classes) in a directory

Great distinctions. Let's classify each of your examples across the **three layers** in your system:

***

| Example | Classification | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. A selection of multiple functions provided in a file and usage in a class of another file** | ✅ **InfoBlocks**⬇️ TieredContext (derived) | The *functions + usage mapping* comes from **SymbolIR + CallGraphIR**, but the *selection* (user-picked or auto-picked chunk) makes it an **InfoBlock**. If you convert it into a reusable format (e.g., show "function providers + usage summary"), it becomes a TieredContext. |
| **2. A selection of all docstrings in a directory** | ✅ **TieredContext** | Derived from **DocIR + SymbolIR**, this is a classic TieredContext: it's a filtered view optimized for LLMs or documentation panels. |
| **3. A selection of all functions and public variables (excluding classes) in a directory** | ✅ **TieredContext** | This is a *curated view* derived from **SymbolIR**, scoped to certain definitions and visibility rules. Could feed LLMs, IDE panes, etc. |

***

### 🧠 Deeper Breakdown

| Layer | Role | What it does in your examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **IR** | Raw, structured semantic data | Provides all symbols, docstrings, call links |
| **InfoBlock** | Focused, semantically coherent *chunk* | A user-selected group of function defs, e.g., *“all `email_*` helpers”* |
| **TieredContext** | Task-optimized view assembled from IR or InfoBlocks | “All docstrings”, “Public API Summary”, “Diagram View” |

***

### 🔁 Pipeline Mapping (Example 1)

**Use Case**: *“Give me a view of 3 helper functions and where they’re used.”*

1. `SymbolIR`: gives function definitions
2. `CallGraphIR`: shows usage in another class
3. ➡ You group these into an **InfoBlock** (user- or rule-defined)
4. ➡ You create a **TieredContext** from it:
   * A “HelperFunction → Usage Map”
   * Or a collapsible sidebar section
   * Or an LLM code prompt

***

### ✅ Summary by Intent

| Your Input | IRs Involved | InfoBlock? | TieredContext? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Functions + usage cross-files | SymbolIR + CallGraphIR | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (if turned into a view) |
| All docstrings in a directory | DocIR + SymbolIR | ❌ | ✅ Yes |
| All functions + constants/enums (no classes) in directory | SymbolIR | ❌ | ✅ Yes |

Would you like a CLI prototype that builds these TieredContexts from InfoBlocks in a directory?

Can a TieredContext be a selection of a uml diagram, some info blocks, and like three files?

Yes — a **TieredContext can absolutely include a UML diagram, InfoBlocks, and raw file content** — that's actually a *powerful and valid design choice*. Think of a TieredContext as a **flexible, task-oriented bundle** that aggregates relevant *representations*, whether semantic, visual, or raw.

***

## ✅ TieredContext = “LLM-ready or UI-ready View”

> A TieredContext is not limited to IR → JSON views. It’s a composable container that can include:

* Visual representations (like UMLs)
* Extracted chunks (InfoBlocks)
* Literal file slices or full files
* Metadata or annotations
* Inline commentary / diagnostics

***

## 🔁 Example Use Case: "Debugging a Buggy Module"

Let’s say you're building a TieredContext to help a developer (or LLM) debug an issue in the `bank/payment` module.

### 👇 This TieredContext might contain:

### 1. ✅ A generated UML Class Diagram

* Derived from `SymbolIR + TypeIR`
* Rendered as a PNG, SVG, or mermaid string
* Shows object layout and method relations

### 2. ✅ Several InfoBlocks

* `initiate_transfer`, `log_failure`, `send_receipt`
* Marked as "High-Risk" from a static analysis pass
* Each InfoBlock = one self-contained chunk (symbol + scope)

### 3. ✅ Raw File Content (or slices)

* Full text of `payment_controller.py`
* Top 100 lines of `audit_logger.py`

### 4. ✅ Metadata or annotations

* Exception flow notes (`ExceptionIR`)
* Commit metadata / git blame
* "Last touched by XYZ"

***

## 💼 Data Structure Concept

Here’s what a flexible TieredContext object might look like:

```json
{
  "name": "debug_view:payment_issue",
  "context_type": "mixed_debug_bundle",
  "sources": ["SymbolIR", "CallGraphIR", "ExceptionIR", "git"],
  "entities": {
    "uml_diagram": "file://uml/payment_uml.svg",
    "infoblocks": [
      "function:payment.initiate_transfer",
      "function:payment.log_failure",
      "function:payment.send_receipt"
    ],
    "files": [
      { "path": "bank/payment/payment_controller.py", "content": "...source..." },
      { "path": "bank/audit/audit_logger.py", "content": "...slice..." }
    ],
    "metadata": {
      "last_modified": "2025-05-31",
      "blame": ["user_x", "user_y"],
      "exceptions_traced": ["TransferFailedException", "LogWriteError"]
    }
  }
}

```

***

## 🧩 Design Rationale

| Element | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **UML diagram** | High-level semantic map (class/object view) |
| **InfoBlocks** | Granular semantic units (relevant functions/regions) |
| **Files** | Literal context if semantic extraction isn’t enough |
| **Metadata** | Useful overlays: git, errors, timestamps, etc. |

***

## 🎯 Summary

> ✅ Yes, a TieredContext can — and should — include:

* A **UML diagram**
* Some **InfoBlocks**
* Raw **files or file slices**
* Any other contextual scaffolding needed for a task

It’s designed to be the **end product** of parsing, IR, compression, and selection — ready for LLM use, dev tools, or visualization layers.

Would you like a YAML or JSON schema for this type of composite TieredContext, including fields like `uml`, `infoblocks`, `files`, `metadata`, etc.?

You've been admirably rigorous so far — and yes, **we’ve been consistent** in the definitions of the three key layers in your architecture: **IRs**, **InfoBlocks**, and **TieredContexts**. But let’s review them carefully and **audit** for any slippage or edge ambiguity.

***

## ✅ Canonical Definitions (As We’ve Used So Far)

### 1. **IR (Intermediate Representation)**

> A complete, structured semantic model, derived from the AST (and optionally runtime data), focused on a specific aspect of the codebase.

* ❗ Not intended to be shown to humans directly.
* 🧱 Example: `SymbolIR`, `CallGraphIR`, `TypeIR`, `ActivityIR`, `DocIR`
* 📥 Feeds: InfoBlock extractors, TieredContext builders

✅ **Consistency so far**: solid. We’ve never used IR to refer to a partial, sliced, or filtered view — only to complete semantic models.

***

### 2. **InfoBlock**

> A semantically meaningful chunk of code/data, selected for relevance or coherence — it may span multiple IRs, but stays bounded and local.

* ⚡ Purpose: Enables contextual reuse of *units* like "helper group", "main function block", or "class + main method"
* 🎯 Used to assemble TieredContexts or for ad-hoc inclusion
* 📏 Rule of thumb: if it could be a collapsible node in an IDE, it's likely an InfoBlock

✅ **Consistency so far**: yes. We've used it to mean:

* "group of related functions"
* "chunk extracted by a user"
* "self-contained logic unit"

🔍 **Ambiguity to watch**: when an InfoBlock includes visual or non-code elements (e.g., a rendered diagram), that might be better classified as part of a TieredContext **unless** it directly maps to a code unit.

***

### 3. **TieredContext**

> A task-optimized bundle of content — composed from IRs and/or InfoBlocks — to be delivered to downstream consumers (e.g., LLMs, GUI, diagrams).

* 📦 Can include:
  * Rendered diagrams (UML, flowcharts)
  * Code slices (from InfoBlocks or raw files)
  * Metadata (from git, telemetry, etc.)
* 🧠 Structured for **compression**, **injection**, or **visualization**
* 📈 Often scoped by tier level (0 = local file, 1 = module, etc.)

✅ **Consistency so far**: yes. We’ve been treating it as the “final product” meant for:

* Visualizations
* LLM prompt input
* IDE assistance

🔍 **Caution zone**: if a TieredContext contains only one InfoBlock and nothing else, it *might look like* an InfoBlock — but the distinction is in **intent and context**, not size.

***

## 🧮 Summary Table

| Term | What it Encodes | Input From | Output To | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **IR** |  | AST, runtime | InfoBlock extractor, tier builder | Global/full |
| **InfoBlock** | Coherent unit or chunk (class, helpers, main + logic) | IRs (filtered) | TieredContext, diagram panel | Local/unit |
| **TieredContext** | Bundled view for purpose (LLM, UI, debug) | IRs + InfoBlocks | LLM, GUI, CLI, TUI, diagrams | Mixed/flexible |

***

## ✅ Conclusion

> You’ve been highly consistent so far.
>
> All three terms are:

* Well-scoped
* Complementary
* Mapped cleanly into your pipeline (AST → IR → InfoBlock → TieredContext)

Would you like a diagram that visually shows how these layers stack and flow into each other?
