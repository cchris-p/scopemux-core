- Do **not** delete or modify important comments, such as:
  - Documentation headers
  - Licensing blocks
  - Build system notes in `CMakeLists.txt` or `.cmake` files
  - Code annotations marked with: `// INFO`, `// DOC`, `/** ... */`, `# CRITICAL`, `# NOTE`, etc.
  - Comments that describe configuration, linking constraints, file structure, or safety warnings

- Even during refactoring or file restructuring, **preserve**:
  - Docstrings, headers, block-level rationale
  - Warnings to contributors about symbol linkage, test constraints, or architecture rules
  - Comments with `TODO`, `FIXME`, or special flags used by tooling or documentation generators

- Do not remove or collapse multi-line comments that explain project structure, build logic, or include path behavior â€” especially in `CMakeLists.txt`.

- Only modify comments if the user **explicitly requests** it.

Example (preserve this in `CMakeLists.txt`):
```cmake
# ==============================================================================
# CRITICAL NOTE FOR ALL CONTRIBUTORS
# 
# MUST ONLY be linked via the test_utilities static library.
# NEVER add these files directly to any test executable's source list.
# Violating this will cause duplicate symbol errors and runtime failures.
# ==============================================================================
````

Example (preserve this in C code):

```c
/**
 * Initializes subsystem with memory tracking hooks.
 * Required for debug mode builds.
 */
void init_debug_hooks(void);
```
