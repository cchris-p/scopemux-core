/**
 * @file cpp_example_ast_tests.c
 * @brief Tests for validating AST extraction against expected JSON output for C++ language
 *
 * This file will contain tests that iterate through each subdirectory of the
 * /home/matrillo/apps/scopemux/core/tests/examples/cpp directory, load C++ source files,
 * extract their ASTs, and validate them against corresponding .expected.json files.
 *
 * Planned subdirectory coverage:
 * - core_tests/examples/cpp/basic_syntax/
 * - core_tests/examples/cpp/templates/
 * - core_tests/examples/cpp/classes/
 * - core_tests/examples/cpp/namespaces/
 * - core_tests/examples/cpp/stl/
 * - core_tests/examples/cpp/modern_cpp/
 * - Any other directories added to examples/cpp/
 *
 * Each test will:
 * 1. Read a C++ source file from examples
 * 2. Parse it into an AST
 * 3. Load the corresponding .expected.json file
 * 4. Compare the AST against the expected JSON output
 * 5. Report any discrepancies
 *
 * This approach provides both regression testing and documentation of
 * the expected parser output for different C++ language constructs.

// TODO: Implement actual tests once JSON validation is fully implemented
